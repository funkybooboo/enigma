## Usage

The Enigma project allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using advanced algorithms. Here is an example of how to use the Enigma encryption and decryption functionalities:

```java
// Instantiate the Enigma class
Enigma enigma = new Enigma();

// Encrypt a message
String encryptedMessage = enigma.encrypt("Hello, World!");

// Decrypt the encrypted message
String decryptedMessage = enigma.decrypt(encryptedMessage);

System.out.println("Encrypted message: " + encryptedMessage);
System.out.println("Decrypted message: " + decryptedMessage);
```
